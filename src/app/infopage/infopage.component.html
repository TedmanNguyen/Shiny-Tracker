<h1> Shiny Pokemon </h1>
<p>
    Shiny Pokemon are a special variant of a Pokemon. Compared to the
    regular/typical variant, shiny Pokemon have a different color scheme and
    may play a "shining" animation at the start of a battle. These Pokemon 
    have identical stats as their regular counterparts, so the only
    differences between them are cosmetic. Shiny Pokemon were Introduced in 
    Generation II.
</p>
<p>
    The odds of encountering a shiny Pokemon during normal gameplay is extremely
    low, with a probability of 1/8196 (for generations II-V) or 1/4096 (for
    generations VI onward). So, obtaining a shiny Pokemon is considered as an
    achievement by many Pokemon players.

<h1> What is Shiny Hunting? </h1>
<p>
    Shiny hunting is when a player uses a special method that increases the
    chances of encountering a shiny Pokemon. Different methods exist in each
    Pokemon generation, with some methods reappearing throughout the series. 
    Additionally, the rates for encountering a shiny Pokemon may differ between
    generations despite using the same method.

                <p>
                    In Generation II, what makes a Pokemon shiny is determined by
                    something called their Individual Values (IVs). Since IVs 
                    can be inherited from parent Pokemon, breeding one shiny
                    Pokemon with another Pokemon increases the chances of obtaining
                    a shiny Pokemon from 1/8196 to 1/64. So, the best (and only) way
                    to increase the odds of getting a shiny Pokemon in Generation II
                    is to breed a shiny Pokemon with another Pokemon.

                <p> <em> Applicable in: Generation IV onward </em> </p>
                <p>
                    The Masuda Method is one of the most iconic shiny hunting methods 
                    in the Pokemon franchise. If two Pokemon from different game
                    languages are bred, the chances of hatching a shiny Pokemon increases.
                    This method was originally created to promote players trading their
                    Pokemon with other players online.

            <mat-tab label="Poke Radar">
                <p> <em> Applicable in: Generation IV, VI, and VIII* </em> </p>
                <p>
                    The Poke Radar is used to find Pokemon hiding in tall grass.
                    If a player "chains" the number of successful encounters they
                    get while using the Poke Radar, their chances of encountering
                    a shiny Pokemon increases. This rate increase stops after 40
                    or more chained encounters.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, the DexNav is used instead of
                    the Poke Radar. Chaining Pokemon with the DexNav does increase the 
                    rates for shiny Pokemon, but the exact mechanics and probability are 
                    unknown. Therefore, Shiny Tracker does not have DexNav as a method 
                    to choose from when creating a tracker.
                </p>
                <small>
                    *Although Poke Radar exists in Generation VIII, Shiny Tracker only
                    supports games between Generations II and VII.

                <p>
                    The concept of chaining also exists in fishing for Generation
                    VI games. Successfully reeling in Pokemon consecutively increases
                    the probability of encountering a shiny Pokemon. This rate increase
                    stops after 20 or more chained encounters.

                <p>
                    SOS Battles are when a wild Pokemon calls for help from another
                    Pokemon. If successful, the ally Pokemon will appear in battle
                    alongside the original wild Pokemon. Defeating the ally Pokemon
                    and stalling the encounter causes subsequent ally Pokemon to have
                    a higher chance of being shiny. This rate increase stops after 31
                    or more chained encounters.

                <p>
                    Also known as shiny resetting, soft resetting is when a player
                    resets the game without saving. Although this method does not
                    increase the rates for a shiny Pokemon, it is used to obtain a 
                    shiny variant of a Pokemon encountered in a scripted event.
                    This is because the Pokemon's stats are determined upon encountering
                    the Pokemon, so exiting the game and re-encountering it gives the 
                    player another chance to encounter the scripted Pokemon as a shiny.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This method exists for all games that have shiny Pokemon. Because
                    the rates of encountering a shiny don't increase with this method,
                    it is only used in specific situations (ex. getting a Legendary
                    Pokemon as a shiny).

<h1> Shiny Charm </h1>
<p>
    Introduced in Pokemon Black 2 and White 2, the Shiny Charm is a key item that
    increases the chances of obtaining a shiny Pokemon by a flat rate. 
    It is obtained by completing the National Pokedex in the respective game,
    which requires capturing almost every Pokemon within that game. Since the 
    Shiny Charm provides a flat rate increase, its effect combines with other 
    shiny hunting methods.
