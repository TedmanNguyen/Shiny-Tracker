Developed in 3 weeks in collaboration with [Cjt101](https://github.com/cjt101) and [sezavala](https://github.com/sezavala), during our time as a Software Intern w/ CodeDay & Computing Talent Intiative. 

### üé• Demo Video: 



## Deliverables:
- [x] Flow of Control for User actions
- [x] Wireframe / Mockup that demonstrates the UI/UX
- [x] Video demo of functional website on local machine
- [x] Readme that helps people how to install the program

### Flow of Control: 


### Resources: 
- 3 Computer Science Students w/ meeting virtually
- 20 hours per week per student for 3 weeks
- 1 Software Engineering Mentor  
- Github Copilot 
- Angular Library  

## Scope:

### In-Scope:
1. Allow the user to create an instance of a hunt, which comes with drop down menus and buttons to select the game they‚Äôre playing, methods used, whether they have the Shiny Charm, and pokemon they‚Äôre hunting
2. Create a Main Page that stores all hunts. Users should be able to delete hunts and add more hunts.
3. Each initiated hunt should have a counter and the rate of obtaining a shiny Pokemon with the given method displayed. It should also have an image of the Pokemon to hunt for.
4. Shiny Hunting Methods should only include Generations 2 - 7 
5. Includes a 2nd page that provides an overview regarding the topic of ‚Äúshiny hunting‚Äù and a short description of each shiny hunting method. Consider using Angular Material for this, as well as for other UI components.

### Out-of-Scope:
1. Shiny-hunting-methods for Generations 8 and after
2. Tracking the amount of time that the user has spent on hunting for that pokemon
3. Specific checks on whether a Pokemon can be obtained by the method chosen. Example: shiny legendary Pokemon cannot be obtained by Masuda Method since they cannot be hatched from eggs

### Constraints:
1. Must be Complete by August 16, 2024.
2. Limited Understanding of Angular & Typescript after working with these technologies on an [Oppia](https://github.com/sezavala/oppia), an open-source project
   
### Requirements:
1. Utilizing API Calls to retrieve Pokemons and Pokemon Images available
2. Storing Information from API response to be used again during single instance of hunt
3. Data persistence between hunts
