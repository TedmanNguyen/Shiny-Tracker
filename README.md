Developed in 3 weeks in collaboration with [Cjt101](https://github.com/cjt101) and [sezavala](https://github.com/sezavala), during our time as a Software Intern w/ CodeDay & Computing Talent Intiative. 

### Resources: 
- 3 Computer Science Students of 20 hours of work for 3 weeks  
- 1 Software Engineering Mentor  
- Github Copilot / Chatgpt  
- Angular Library  


## Deliverables:
- [x] Flow of Control for User actions
- [x] Wireframe / Mockup that demonstrates the UI/UX
- [x] Video demo of functional website on local machine
- [x] Readme that helps people how to install the program

## In-Scope:
1. Allow the user to create an instance of a hunt, which comes with drop down menus and buttons to select the game they’re playing, methods used, whether they have the Shiny Charm, and pokemon they’re hunting
2. Create a Main Page that stores all hunts. Users should be able to delete hunts and add more hunts.
3. Each initiated hunt should have a counter and the rate of obtaining a shiny Pokemon with the given method displayed. It should also have an image of the Pokemon to hunt for.
4. Shiny Hunting Methods should only include Generations 2 - 7 
5. Includes a 2nd page that provides an overview regarding the topic of “shiny hunting” and a short description of each shiny hunting method. Consider using Angular Material for this, as well as for other UI components.

## Out-of-Scope:
1. Shiny-hunting-methods for Generations 8 and after
2. Tracking the amount of time that the user has spent on hunting for that pokemon
3. Specific checks on whether a Pokemon can be obtained by the method chosen. Example: shiny legendary Pokemon cannot be obtained by Masuda Method since they cannot be hatched from eggs

## Constraints:
1. Must be Complete by August 16, 2024.
2. Limited Understanding of Angular & Typescript after working with these technologies for 5 weeks

## Requirements:
1. Utilizing API Calls to retrieve Pokemons and Pokemon Images available
2. Storing Information from API response to be used again during single instance of hunt
3. Data persistence between hunts
